# SpellGarden Backlog

A running list of cleanup tasks, tech debt, and low-priority improvements to revisit.
Work through these top to bottom — each item is its own focused session, commit, and PR.

## 1. Performance (More involved, investigate first)

### Reduce unused JavaScript (~83 KiB / ~450ms savings)
- **What:** Lighthouse flags 83 KiB of unused JavaScript, with an estimated 450ms LCP improvement if deferred. Likely caused by Firebase and Framer Motion being loaded eagerly on page load.
- **Fix:** First, investigate with `next build --analyze` (requires adding `@next/bundle-analyzer` as a dev dependency). Then look at lazy-loading modals (`dynamic(() => import(...))`) and deferring Firebase initialization until it's actually needed.
- **Priority:** Low-Medium — meaningful load time improvement, especially on mobile.
- **Spotted:** Lighthouse audit, Feb 2026

## 2. Major Upgrades (Plan carefully, do last)

### Update Next.js to address high-severity DoS vulnerabilities
- **What:** The current Next.js 14.x has two high-severity CVEs: DoS via Image Optimizer `remotePatterns` misconfiguration and HTTP request deserialization via insecure React Server Components.
- **Fix:** First check if a patched 14.x release is available. If not, plan a deliberate upgrade to Next.js 15 — `npm audit fix --force` would jump to Next.js 16 which is a large breaking change and needs proper testing.
- **Priority:** Medium — high severity, but DoS vectors are server-side. Assess actual exposure before treating as urgent.
- **Spotted:** `npm audit`, Feb 2026

### Review and clean up ESLint-related vulnerabilities
- **What:** Several moderate/high CVEs in `ajv`, `minimatch`, `brace-expansion`, and `glob` trace back to ESLint dev dependencies. Fixing requires downgrading ESLint to v4 (a major breaking change) and is not worth it right now.
- **Fix:** These are dev-only and have zero production impact. Revisit naturally when upgrading ESLint to a newer major version.
- **Priority:** Low — dev-only, no production impact. Safe to defer indefinitely.
- **Spotted:** `npm audit`, Feb 2026
